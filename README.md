**This package is under active development, things are likley to change often, some things might not work.**

# Introduction

`ltdesigntester` is a way of generating distance sampling survey data (using [`DSsim`](https://github.com/distancedevelopment/DSsim)) and fitting different spatial models to the resulting data and assessing the results.

Details of an example analysis can be found in [this report](https://github.com/dill/spatlaugh/blob/master/report/report.pdf) (though you may prefer to see the simulation code [here](https://github.com/dill/spatlaugh/tree/master/simulation_study) or the source of that report [here](https://github.com/dill/spatlaugh/blob/master/report/report.lyx)).

Initial work on this package was funded by the International Whaling Commission and carried out by David L Miller and Mark V Bravington during 2016-2017. It is likely that most of the functionality supplied by `ltdesigntester` will be assimilated into `DSsim` in the near future.

# Examples

Some examples of how to use the package are given [here](https://github.com/dill/spatlaugh/tree/master/workshop/example_analyses).
